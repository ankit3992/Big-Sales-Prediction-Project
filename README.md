# Big-Sales-Prediction-Project using Random Forest Regressor

## Overview

This project aims to develop an accurate and reliable sales prediction model using Python and the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. 
The model forecasts future sales for a business, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning.

## Objectives

- **Data Preparation and Preprocessing:** Collect and preprocess historical sales data.
- **Model Development:** Implement the Random Forest Regressor algorithm.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyze the importance of different features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ².
- **Scalability:** Ensure the model can handle large datasets.
- **Visualization and Reporting:** Present the prediction results and feature importance clearly.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model for real-time sales forecasting.

## About the Dataset-

The dataset consists of 12 Varaibles:

1. Item_Identifier - This is an object type column and it has no null values. It contains unique identifiers for each item.
2. Item_Weight - This is a float type column and it has some null values. It represents the weight of each item.
3. Item_Fat_Content - This is an object type column and it has no null values. It represents the fat content of each item.
4. Item_Visibility - This is a float type column and it has no null values. It might represent the visibility of each item in the store.
5. Item_Type - This is an object type column and it has no null values. It represents the type of each item.
6. Item_MRP - This is a float type column and it has no null values. It represents the maximum retail price of each item.
7. Outlet_Identifier - This is an object type column and it has no null values. It contains unique identifiers for each outlet.
8. Outlet_Establishment_Year - This is an integer type column and it has no null values. It represents the year each outlet was established.
9. Outlet_Size - This is an object type column and it has no null values. It represents the size of each outlet.
10. Outlet_Location_Type - This is an object type column and it has no null values. It represents the location type of each outlet.
11. Outlet_Type - This is an object type column and it has no null values. It represents the type of each outlet.
12. Item_Outlet_Sales - This is a float type column and it has no null values. It represents the sales of each item at each outlet.
